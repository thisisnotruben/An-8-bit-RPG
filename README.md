## Tools used

- [Godot 4.5.1](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)

### TODO

- Iterate through characters
	- apply sfx
	- make sure animations are correct
	- make sure animation names in tree are in fsm "move" code for direction
	- come up with stats for chracters
		- maybe modulate color for different characters?
- Icons I need to make for Tiled Map Editor for character creation
	- make_character_icons: [Evil_Snowman] has no 'idle' anim.
	- make_character_icons: [GiantSnail] has no 'idle' anim.
	- make_character_icons: [Hedgehog] has no 'idle' anim.
	- make_character_icons: [Panda] has no 'idle' anim.

### Bugs

- when hud is open player still moves when what is desired is to lock movement.
- fix fire animation, what godot and tiled show is different.
- tiled 'Docks' tileset, I cannot find the file to add collisions, maybe it's embedded?
- 'Tiled' tile collisions don't work on tile objects, fix that.
