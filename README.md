### TODO

- Iterate through characters
	- apply sfx
	- make sure animations are correct
	- make sure animation names in tree are in fsm "move" code for direction
	- come up with stats for chracters
		- maybe modulate color for different characters?
- GUI
	- make HUD
		- come up how the GUI looks and fix the look
- Tilesets to make
	- desolate desert
	- dungeon
	- farm
	- forgotten plains
	- towns 1
	- castles and strongholds
	- raided village
	- ships and docks
	- builders
- Icons I need to make for Tiled Map Editor for character creation
	- make_character_icons: [Evil_Snowman] has no 'idle' anim.
	- make_character_icons: [GiantSnail] has no 'idle' anim.
	- make_character_icons: [Hedgehog] has no 'idle' anim.
	- make_character_icons: [Panda] has no 'idle' anim.
- Make templated buildings for villages
	- find out how you're going to implement the buildings in respect to y-sort
- Make templated characters for orcs, goblins, etc...
- download all patreon exclusives which include characters
	- import them for Godot usage

## Plan
1. Create templated buildings (in TODO)
	- So that you can get started on the map
2. Create a vision of the map on how you want to make it
	- Involves creating a storyline
		- from that storyline, you'll know which npc's you'll need
3. Create the npc's for the game
