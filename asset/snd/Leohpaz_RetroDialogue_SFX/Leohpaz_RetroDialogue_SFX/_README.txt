How to use the sounds:

Blips (Synth, Typewriter, Keyboard)
- There are variations for all types of blips:
  - Synths have different pitches to indicate different voices (low, mid, high);
  - Typewriter and Keyboard also have different "voices";
  - For each voice of the Typewriter and the Keyboard there are 3 variations that should be shuffled each time it is played played;
- These sounds should be played in your game while a character is speaking (letters appearing one by one in the dialogue window);
- Play the sounds every time a letter appears in the text or loop them in fixed time intervals;
- Synth blips can be played either interrupting the last call or not;
  - Bubble_Low will work best being played once every 0.127 seconds (or approximate)
  - All other synths will work best being played once every 0.079 seconds
- Typewriter and Keyboard will sound better if they play over the previous sound instead of interrupting it;


Window sounds
- Popups can be used either for dialogue or emotes (as shown in the cover image);
- Use them normally

Be creative! Change pitches, mix sounds, use window sounds as blips! Feel free to experiment.
