You know where I took inspiration for this asset pack, so you probably already have an idea of what to expect.

Here you will find cries divided into 3 registers:
- High
- Medium
- Low

Each folder will have 30 files. The first 15 files of each folder contains quicker sounds (more notes happening quickly), while the last 15 files (16 to 30) have less sounds (slower cries).
