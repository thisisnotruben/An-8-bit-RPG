Minifantasy - GUI does not include fonts. 

I suggest using a low-resolution font of your choice to maintain the pixel art retro feel of the assets.

For nice low-res fonts, I recommend checking out the work of this fellow creator,https://itch.io/profile/somepx, especially Humble Fonts Tiny I and II.

For maximum readability, I recommend using black text. If you want to use other colors, dark shades of earth tones, maroon, navy blue, or violet work well.

As a general rule, avoid light or highly saturated colors for fontsâ€”they're often difficult to read. When highlighting text, adjust the color values as needed, but always prioritize readability.
