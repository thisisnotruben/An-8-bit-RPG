There are two options for the tileset: Ethereal and Solid.

The Ethereal option is the original design, and you will get the best results (oneiric and unreal feel) by using it.

The Solid option has been included as a second choice for people who don't want to use a tileset with an alpha value, or for those using an engine that doesn't allow the use of several layers.

The Ethereal option was created with the idea of having a black background. However, the set also works with backgrounds of any dark color, yielding quite interesting results.

Keep in mind that depending on the background color you may need to adjust the intensitu of the Shadow layers.

Feel free to experiment! :)
