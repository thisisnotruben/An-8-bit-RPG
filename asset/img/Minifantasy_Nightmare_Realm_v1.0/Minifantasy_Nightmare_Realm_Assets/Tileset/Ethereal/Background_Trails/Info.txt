This is a special tile set designed to create trails that cross the background of the scene (under the floating platforms).

The tiles are 136x136px.

This should be the second layer at the bottom (after your Background layer).

You can extend each trail as much as you need by repeating the pattern.

You can also adjust the alpha value of the trail to create softer effects.
