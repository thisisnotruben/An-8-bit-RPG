Overlay the layers included in this Asset pack above or below the characters and monsters to get the desired effects.



+ Addon Effects for Minifantasy - Weapons

The assets in this folder are designed to be used in combination with the character animations from the 'Minifantasy - Weapons' asset pack.



+ Stand-Alone Effects

The assets in this folder are a compilation of attack, hit and status effects.
They are designed to be used as stand-alone effects to enhance character's or enemy's attacks. 
They can also be used for other purposes.


+ Important:

Front layers (marked with '_f' at the end of the file name) should be rendered after the character sprite, on top of it.

Back layers (marked with '_b' at the end of the file name) should be rendered before the character sprite, below it.

Some weapon effects don't need to make differences between front and back layers. Those ones only include Front layers.
