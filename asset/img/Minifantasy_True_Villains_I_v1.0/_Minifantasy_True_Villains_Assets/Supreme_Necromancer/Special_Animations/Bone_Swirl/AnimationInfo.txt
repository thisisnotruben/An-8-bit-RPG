*Frame size* 

- 32x32px: For "Bone_Swirl_Cast" and "Bone_Impact".
- 64x64px: For "Bone_Swirl_Rise" and "Bone_Swirl"

*Frame Duration*

- 100ms: For all the animations.


NOTES:

- The Swirl starts with the character doing "Bone_Swirl_Cast"
- "Bone_Swirl_Rise" has the same duration as "Bone_Swirl_Cast" and they should start simultaneously
- "Bone_Swirl_Rise" can be centered on the character (and follow them as they move)
- "Bone_Swirl" has 3 rows. Each row has a decreasing amount of bones (the idea is that bones get destroyed upon impact)
