This guideline is designed to help you understand how to get the most from this tileset.

You can find 2 main help elements: 
- A colour code for wall links (tiles with the same colour code in both connecting ends fit)
- Groups and arrows that show which elements can be overlayed/combined.

You can check 'Use_Guidelines.png' for quick reference, or overlay 'Use_Guidelines_Layer' on the tileset if you want to have it visible while working with the sprite sheet in your preferred software.
