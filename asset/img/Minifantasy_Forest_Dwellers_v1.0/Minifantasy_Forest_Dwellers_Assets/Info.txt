Minifantasy - Forest Dwellers features a diverse collection of nature-based creatures and monsters divided into three distinct categories. Each of these categories has a thematic thread that links all their respective creatures. They have been designed to make sure they fit into a believable ecosystem and to inspire interesting game mechanics.

+ Woodborn: Sentient treepeople that protect and heal the forests.

- Tree Spirits: Small saplings that heal the forest and its inhabitants (five models based on different trees*)
- Forest guardians: When a Tree Spirit grows, it turns into a guardian. These warriors protect the forest against malicious forces (five models based on different trees* with two variations each)

*These tree variations are consistent with tree types available in the collection: Birch, Hickory, Oak, Pine and Willow.


+ Grimflorals: Predatory flower-like monsters that inhabit deep jungles and murky swamps.

- Creeperlings: Hyperactive small plant-like monsters whose only drive is an insatiable hunger
- Alpha Creeper: If a Creeperling feeds on enough prey for a long period, it turns into an Alpha Creeper, a big monstrosity that even preys on other powerful monsters.


+ Necromyces: Parasitic colonies formed by horrible fungal creatures.

- Necrothallus: A horrendous monstrosity formed, or covered by, a colony of parasitic fungus.
- Necrofungus: Parasitic creatures that are always looking for new hosts, preferably humanoid.
- Fungified Corpse: A zombified host used by Necrofungus to overwhelm possible attackers and spread their colonies.
