This guideline is designed to help you understand how to get the most from this tileset.

The Groups and arrows show which elements can be overlayed/combined.

You can check 'Use_Guidelines.png' for quick reference, or overlay 'Use_Guidelines_Layer' on the sprite sheet if you want to have it visible while working with the sprite sheet in your preferred software.
