The Goblin Raider includes two versions, with and without a torch.

The original idea for the creature is as follows:
- Goblin Raiders show up carrying torches
- They get just one ranged attack (throwing the torch)
- After they have thrown the torch they just use regular melee attacks

Of course, it is just a suggestion, you can use the assets in the way that best fit your needs!
