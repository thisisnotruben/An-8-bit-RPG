*Frame size* 

- 64x64px: For all the animations.


*Frame Duration*

- 100ms: Attack, Dmg, Die

- 200ms:  Idle and Walk

Notes:
- You can build the Balrog animation with or without the wings.
- Wing layers are named with “_f” or “_b” at the end.
- “_f” stands for “front view” of the character, while “_b” stands for back view of the character.
- The “_f” layer should be placed under/rendered before the character (as the character body partially covers the wings layer).
- The “_b” layer should be placed above/rendered after the character (as the wings partially cover the character layer).
