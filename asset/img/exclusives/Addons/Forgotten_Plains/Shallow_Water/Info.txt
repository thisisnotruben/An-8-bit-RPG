*Frame size* 

8x8px for all water tiles


*Frame Duration*

Adjust to your liking, I recommend 200ms or 300ms



Notes:

+ For characters entering in water:

- For the ligthest color water, I suggest removing a line of 1 pixel from the bottom for each animation row (to simulate the depth and the character sinking in).

- For the middle color water,  I suggest removing a line of 2 pixels  from the bottom for each animation row (to simulate the depth and the character sinking in).

- The darkes water color (the original), can be treated as an impassable obstacle, or one you need swim in (remember there are swimming animations for the base character in the summer holiday addon).
