This guideline is designed to help you understand how to get the most from this add-on.

The Groups show the function of the different elements.

You can check 'Use_Guidelines.png' for quick reference, or overlay 'Use_Guidelines_Layer' on the sprite sheet if you want to have it visible while working with the sprite sheet in your preferred software.

NOTES:

- Most of the icons displayed in the signs come from the already broad selection included in Crafting And Professions.
- Signs come in alternative sign shapes and colors to match the Medieval City assets.
- There are three new icons representing Tavern/Inn/Infirmary-like places (the bed/jar/cross at the right end of each sign type group).
- New posts and hangs for the signs.
- Optional "combinable" icon signs.
