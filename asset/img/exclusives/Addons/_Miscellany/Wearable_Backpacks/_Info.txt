5 backpack designs in 5 colours 
(first frame of the idle animation in the 4 directions for each backpack).

Each backpack has 2 layers. 
One to be rendered/placed before the character (when the character is facing front), 
and another one to be rendered/placed after the character (when the character is facing back).

To use the backpacks in other animations, you will need to create an extra layer 
with the backpacks in the correct offset for each frame of a given animation.
