Notes:

a- The "Ossuary_Skeleton_Spawning.png" rows display spawning animations that match all Ossuary tiles available on Minifantasy â€“ Crypt Of The Forgotten.

b- After a skeleton has spawned, you can replace that ossuary tile with the matching tile from "Ossuary_Tiles_After_Spawn.png" to leave a bone gap in the Ossuary. Alternatively, you can leave the Ossuary without a gap if you want to keep spawning skeletons continuously from the same Ossuary tile.

c- I have included a guideline image to help you quickly visualize which tiles from this add-on correspond with the original Ossuary tiles from Minifantasy - Crypt Of The Forgotten.
