*Frame size* 

- 64x64px


*Frame Duration*

- 100ms



Notes:
- The sprite sheets are divided in 3 rows: 1. Preparing, 2. Holding, 3. Casting
- You can ignore the Holding row for a shorter casting time
- You can loop the Holding row for a longer casting time
- The frames number 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the 3rd row (casting row) are composed of just a flat white color (or an trasnparent white). This color should be extended to the rest of the screen to achieve the effect you see in the mockups
- 'Super_Tier_Magic_Effect' layer should be rendered over the character casting the spell
- 'Super_Tier_Magic_Ground_Effect' layer should be rendered under the character casting the spell
