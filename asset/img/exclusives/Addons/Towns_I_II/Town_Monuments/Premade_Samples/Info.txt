When making your custom monuments, to achieve similar results to the premade samples:

- You will need to work with different layers and outside the boundaries of the 8x8 grid. 

- Some elements will need to be placed offset to be aligned to your liking.

- I recommend assembling them on Aseprite, or a similar software, before adding custom monuments to your game.
