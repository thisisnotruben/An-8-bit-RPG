You can overlay the Shop walls over any building interior tileset from the collection. 
I overlayed it over the indoor tileset of "Minifantasy - Towns I" as a sample.

You can place different shop items (the small props) on different counters to make different compositions.

You can mix and match props from different assets packs in the collection to create other kinds of shops.
