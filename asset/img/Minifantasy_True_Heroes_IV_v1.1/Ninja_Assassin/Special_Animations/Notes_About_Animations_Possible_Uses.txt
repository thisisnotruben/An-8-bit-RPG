- When the Ninja "Enter_The_Shadows," they will be in sneak-mode.
- Attacking from the shadows could deal more damage, but it forces sneak-mode out.
- Receiving damage when the ninja is in the shadows also forces sneak-mode out.


- "Deadly_Dash" and "Thousand_Blades" could be used to teleport over enemies.
- "Thousand_Blades" can be chained to attack a group of enemies (for example, one frame of the effect on each nearby enemy).


- "Smoke_Bomb" is meant to teleport the Ninja away from harm.
