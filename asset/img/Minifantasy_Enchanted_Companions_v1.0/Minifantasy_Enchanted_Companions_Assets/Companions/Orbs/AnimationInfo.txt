Notes:

- These orbs have been designed with the idea of being used as orbiting or wandering entities that follows the player. 

- They can apply effects upon contact with the enemies, such as burn (fire), freeze (ice), knock back (air) or stun (rock), for example.

- Best results in combination with the effects from Minifantasy - Magic Weapons And Effects.
