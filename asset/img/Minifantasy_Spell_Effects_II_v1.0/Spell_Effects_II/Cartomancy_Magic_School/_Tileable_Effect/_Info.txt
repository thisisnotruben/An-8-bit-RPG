NOTES:

- To build special Impact animations, start with a Tileable_Effect.png and then select one of the following six options and their respective effects from the folder /_Fate/ in the root directory:

- Death (a damage-over-time effect)
- Emperor (a tileable wall effect for self-protection and keeping enemies at bay)
- Hermit (a blink effect for safe teleportation)
- Sun (a confusion/blind effect)
- Sword (a direct damage effect)
- Wheel (randomly applies buffs or debuffs to self/allies or enemies - additional status effects available in Minifantasy - Magic Weapons & Effects)

- These are tiled effects that allows you to create custom spell patterns (see the Premade_Spell_Effects folder in this asset pack for examples and inspiration)
