In this asset pack, you will find the props in 5 different folders organized by themes.
Each theme contains a selection of props compatible with several Minifantasy asset packs.

+ Deserts and wastelands

+ Icy wilderness and harsh winters

+ Plains and forests

+ Swamps and wetlands

+ Weird and evil


This is simply a way to keep the props organized and easily accessible. 
I encourage you to mix and match the different assets between them and with different Minifantasy packs.

For example, some bushes from ‘Deserts and Wastelands’ theme fit really well into Minifantasy - Forgotten Plains; 
while the vines from ‘Weird and Evil’ will perfectly integrate with Minifantasy - Lost Jungle or Silent Swamp.
