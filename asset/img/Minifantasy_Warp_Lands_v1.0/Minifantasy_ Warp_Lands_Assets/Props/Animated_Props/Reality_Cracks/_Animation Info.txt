Notes:
- These props are meant to be used as ways in and out of the Warp Lands
- Shadow layers are used only with Reality_Crack_Out
- You can use these props as static or animated ones

- The background in the GIFs is used as an example. It has been created using Minifantasy - Tiny Overworld asset pack (not included in Minifantasy - Warp Lands)
- However, the reality cracks have been created to work with any other Minifantasy set
